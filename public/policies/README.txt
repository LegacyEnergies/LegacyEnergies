Place your published PDF policies in this folder.

The /compliance/documents page links directly to files under /policies/.
If your filenames contain spaces or special characters (like '&'), the site will URL-encode them automatically.

Tip: For clean URLs, you may rename files to simple slugs (e.g., anti-bribery.pdf) and update app/compliance/documents/page.tsx accordingly.
